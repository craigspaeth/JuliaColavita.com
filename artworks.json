Originally from Philadelphia, PA, she received her BA in studio art from Hartwick College in 2005, after which she was invited to study with artist and activist Checo Valdez in Mexico. There, she facilitated community mural projects in Mexico City and Chiapas, returning briefly in 2009 to collaborate again with Valdez and other international artists on a Zappatista mural project. In 2006 Colavita was awarded the Maggie and Bob Allesse Fellowship with the NEA- funded organization Artrain USA, allowing her to focus on and exhibit her own work while at the same time bringing fine arts programing to small communities nationwide. In 2010 she completed her MFA at the New York Academy of Art, though she has been working and exhibiting her art in New York since 2006.","blurb":"","education":"2010Â Â Â  New York Academy of Art-MFA Painting\n2005Â Â Â  Hartwick College- BA Studio Art, Concentration in Painting\n","awards":"","publications":"","collections":"","soloexhibitions":"","groupexhibitions":"2012\tAffordable Art Fair, Recent Graduates Section, New York, NY                                    \tIndoor/Outdoor, Curated by Brooklyn Haus, Hosted by Create NYC, New York, NY \tObsessions, Fireproof Gallery, Booklyn NY\n2011Â Â Â  Holiday Salon, Lesley Heller Gallery, New York, NY\n\tFoolsgold Sanctuary, Exhibtion Benefit for Catskill Animal Sanctuary, 94 Prince St. Gallery,   \tNew York, NY\n\tCurate NYC Online Exhibition, Curated by Lowery Stokes Sims, Curater of the Museum of Arts \tand Design\n\tContemporary Abstractions, Powerhouse Arena, Brooklyn, NY, Curated by Mighty Tanaka,  \tVander-Onderdonk Sculpture Garden, V.O.

Originally from Philadelphia, PA, she received her BA in studio art from Hartwick College in 2005, after which she was invited to study with artist and activist Checo Valdez in Mexico. There, she facilitated community mural projects in Mexico City and Chiapas, returning briefly in 2009 to collaborate again with Valdez and other international artists on a Zappatista mural project. In 2006 Colavita was awarded the Maggie and Bob Allesse Fellowship with the NEA- funded organization Artrain USA, allowing her to focus on and exhibit her own work while at the same time bringing fine arts programing to small communities nationwide. In 2010 she completed her MFA at the New York Academy of Art, though she has been working and exhibiting her art in New York since 2006.","blurb":"","education":"2010Â Â Â  New York Academy of Art-MFA Painting\n2005Â Â Â  Hartwick College- BA Studio Art, Concentration in Painting\n","awards":"","publications":"","collections":"","soloexhibitions":"","groupexhibitions":"2012\tAffordable Art Fair, Recent Graduates Section, New York, NY                                    \tIndoor/Outdoor, Curated by Brooklyn Haus, Hosted by Create NYC, New York, NY \tObsessions, Fireproof Gallery, Booklyn NY\n2011Â Â Â  Holiday Salon, Lesley Heller Gallery, New York, NY\n\tFoolsgold Sanctuary, Exhibtion Benefit for Catskill Animal Sanctuary, 94 Prince St. Gallery,   \tNew York, NY\n\tCurate NYC Online Exhibition, Curated by Lowery Stokes Sims, Curater of the Museum of Arts \tand Design\n\tContemporary Abstractions, Powerhouse Arena, Brooklyn, NY, Curated by Mighty Tanaka,  \tVander-Onderdonk Sculpture Garden, V.O.
